Nearby Schools Data Analysis Script

This script provides comprehensive analysis of the school_polygon_relationships 
and nearby_school_polygons tables, specifically focused on location coverage 
and data completeness.

Features:
- Summary statistics for nearby schools data coverage
- Breakdown by drive time (5, 10, 15 minutes) 
- Location points coverage analysis
- EDC schools specific analysis
- Data completeness validation
- Export to CSV for detailed analysis
